Notes
  
    An order book is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a security or other instrument organized by price level
    Order books are used by almost every exchange for various assets like stocks, bonds, currencies, and even cryptocurrencies
    These lists help improve market transparency as they provide information on price, availability, depth of trade, and who initiates transactions
    There are three parts to an order book: buy orders, sell orders, and order history
    => A limit order to sell is called an "ask".
    Iceberg order is a conditional request made to the broker/system to buy or sell a large required quantity of stock, but in smaller predetermined quantity
